    <p>
        I'm currently studying at the University of British Columbia, Master of Journalism. This website is used for self-taught purposes.
        If I become famous (hopefully!), you can come back and see how things started here.
        I have a dream: starting my own magazine, business, and writing my own code. I pride myself as a designer, and I realized
        I particularly enjoy the process of building something. It makes me feel productive, useful, and distracts me from the mundane matters 
        that really bug me.
